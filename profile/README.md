## What is WebStorm?  

**WebStorm** is a powerful **integrated development environment (IDE)** created by JetBrains, built specifically for web developers working with **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, Angular, Node.js**, and other modern frameworks. It provides an intelligent coding experience that accelerates productivity and ensures clean, maintainable code.  

At its core, WebStorm features a deeply **context-aware code engine** that offers smart completion, real-time error detection, refactoring tools, and code navigation — helping you write high-quality code faster. Its **integrated debugger**, **unit testing support**, and **version control tools** (Git, GitHub, Mercurial) make it an all-in-one workspace for front-end and full-stack developers.  

WebStorm goes beyond basic text editing — it understands your project structure, manages dependencies, and integrates seamlessly with build tools like **npm, Yarn, Webpack, Vite**, and **Docker**. Its **live editing preview** allows instant feedback in the browser, while the **terminal, REST client, and database tools** keep everything accessible in one place.  

Optimized for **macOS** and **Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)**, WebStorm ensures fast performance, smooth scrolling, and responsive UI across large codebases. It’s the ideal development environment for professionals who need precision, flexibility, and deep integration with modern web technologies.
